# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Data Structures
1. Subset, Subsequence, Subarray
   1. Subset - unordered, (contiguous or non-contiguous)
   2. Subsequence - ordered, (contiguous or non-contiguous), like ordered set
   3. Subarray - ordered and contiguous

## Algorithms
1. If a list can have upto a fixed number of elements, for instance, count of alphabets in an array, which makes its lenght maximum 26, then even linear search which looks like O(n) would be O(26) => O(1) i.e, Constant time

## Topics to cover
1. Python DataClasses
